This repository contains Python scripts showing how you can use Microsoft AirSim to collect image data,
then use that data to train a deep-learning neural net in TensorFlow.  

# Prerequisites

AirSim uses UnrealEngine4, whose creators specify these 
[requirements](https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Recommended_Hardware).  Although it is possible build
AirSim on OS X and Linux, we found it easiest to use the pre-compiled binaries in 
the [Neighborhood](https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim/releases/download/v1.1.7/Neighbourhood.zip)
example.
